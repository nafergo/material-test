Override the default color scheme by setting `mdl_colors` in `_config.yml` to a supported Material Design Lite scheme (e.g. indigo-pink, deep_orange-blue).  Color schemes can be overridden on a single page by setting `mdl_colors` in the front matter. Use the [MDL theme builder](https://getmdl.io/customize/index.html) to find color schemes.

This page has `mdl_colors` set to `deep_orange-blue`.
